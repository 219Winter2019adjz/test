Help (but very brief) guide that I created with useful Terminal commands for using Git.
Note the link at the end of this document.

ls :see files in current directory
pwd :see current file path
cd :change directory
cd .. :go back a directory level
cd ~/ :return to home directory

open :use to open a document in current directory
open -a <application> :opens an application, regardless of current file path
open Downloads/Instructions.doc -a <Program> :open a file with specified program

cp <File Name> <FileName>-Copy.<File Extension> :copy a file or directory
	e.g. cp TestFile.txt TestFile-Copy.txt
mv: move a file
mv <File name.extension> <New file name.extension> :renames a file
rm :removes file or directory (use cd .. to back out of a directory before deleting it)

To add files:
git status :allows you to see which files it thinks exist
	e.g. It might say:
 		Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
		Untracked files:
			  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
		TestFile_ToBeDeleted.txt
		nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
git add <File name> :adds a file to the staging environment (do this for all files you want to add)
git commit :tell git to package to package all added files into a commit
git commit -m "<insert message about commit here>"
git checkout -b <my branch name> :Create a new branch and check it out	
	(Git now places you in this branch)
git branch :confirm that ^branch was created
git push origin <my branch name> :creates a branch in the repo
** Now go to GitHub and manually merge the pull request
	(compare & pull request)
	(if merge button is grey it means that there is a merge conflict)
** Delete branch to tidy up the workspace (grey button)
git pull origin master :command that allows you to get most recent changes that have been merged 
git log :see all new commits
git checkout master :switch branches back to the master branch
	use git pull if branch is behind
